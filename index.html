		<p>Hi, my name is Richard, and I‚Äôm here today to talk to you about what is best in life.</p>
		<p>About my background: I started out at university studying engineering, and I hated it. I quickly switched to a philosophy degree, which I loved. Now, ten years later, my job title is front end engineer. I guess engineering isn't so bad after all?</p>

		<p>I‚Äôve now been coming to FEL regularly for about four years, but this is my first time getting up on stage. When I first started coming, I was a bit too nervous to actually talk to anyone in the pub, so I‚Äôd just go straight home after the talks.</p>
		<p>But over time I started actually talking to people, and it‚Äôs become a big part of my life in London. I‚Äôve met some close friends here. I found a new coworker here. I learned about the codebar community here, and now I‚Äôm an organiser there, and you should totally come join us! And I got my current job through the FEL slack group, which you should also totally join! (Patrick, you‚Äôre welcome). And none of that would have happened without FEL, so, thanks Made by Many!</p>

		<p>Actually, it's about ethics in software engineering.</p>
		<p>I mentioned that my official job title these days is front-end engineer, though I usually refer to myself as a developer. I've always felt a bit uncomfortable with the title of engineer, though I couldn't really put my finger on why. Maybe it felt a bit like I was claiming some sort of prestige that I hadn't earned?</p>
		<p>I didn't complete my engineering degree, and I didn't study computer science: I'm mostly self-taught. I think I‚Äôm pretty good at my job, but I still feel like I'm basically hacking stuff together a lot of the time.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, we who build websites used to call ourselves webmasters - which I still think is a great job title. I'm kinda sad that I didn't start this job early enough to have a webmaster job in CV job history section.</p>
		<p>Then we were web developers, and now a lot of us are front-end engineers.</p>
		<p>I don‚Äôt think that's a bad thing, or that we should stop calling ourselves engineers - call yourself whatever you want, you can be a techno-viking or an agile pirate-ninja riding a full-stack glitter-unicorn if it makes you feel better.</p>

		<p>We used to be working on dinky little websites that were kind of thrown together, and now we're working on massive, professional operations that form the financial backbone of multi-billion dollar corporations. We've come a long, long way from being webmasters.</p>
		<p>But a lot of us are self-taught and didn't go through any standardised training process. And don't get me wrong, this is great, it helps ease barriers to entry. But as the industry gets more professional, it might be worth thinking about other trappings of professionalism. If we're going to call ourselves engineers, then there are ethical duties and codes of responsibility that go along with that title.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>A hundred years ago, engineers were in a similar situation to how the tech industry is now. Engineering projects ballooned in scale and complexity, and engineers grew more sophisticated and professional in their approach.</p>
		<p>But as projects became more ambitious, there was an accompanying problem: A rise in engineering disasters. The turn of the twentieth century saw a wave of major structural failures, including some massive bridge failures, and also the Great Boston Molasses Flood, which you can see here.</p>
		<p>Which, if I had to name my favourite disaster of all time, this would have to be it, just for the mental image of a tsunami of liquid sugar 50 feet high, consuming everything in its path. It's terrifying, but also, kinda delicious?</p>
		<p>Anyway these disasters had a profound effect on the way the public saw engineering, and forced the profession to confront their shortcomings, particularly in ethical standards.</p>

		<p>Philosophers like to do things called "thought experiments", which are like real experiments but even better, because you never need to get out of your armchair.</p>
		<p>One of the most famous is the trolley problem. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with it, but for those who aren't, here's the deal.</p>
	</aside>

<section data-background="img/trolley-problem.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:</p>
		<p>Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.</p>
		<p>Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.</p>
		<p>Which is the most ethical choice? Quick show of hands, no wrong answers.</p>

<section data-background="img/fat-man.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Now, imagine instead of a switch, you‚Äôre standing on a bridge over the tracks, next to an extremely large man. The trolley is coming, and the only way you can stop it is to push the large man onto the tracks. He‚Äôs the only one big enough to slow down the trolley.</p>
		<p>He‚Äôs looking you right in the eyes, he can see what you‚Äôre thinking, and he‚Äôs terrified, begging you not to do it. What do you do?</p>

	<p>9 out of 10 people would throw the switch,</p>
	<p>but only 1 in 10 people would push the large man.</p>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys, which tend to find that approximately 9 out of 10 respondents would throw the switch to kill the one and save the five.</p>
		<p>However in the large man scenario, the situation reverses, and only 1 in 10 people would push him onto the tracks.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, a 2009 survey of professional philosophers found that only 68% of them would throw the switch, 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer. So if you‚Äôre ever tied to a train track by a cartoon villain, you‚Äôd better hope that the person by the switch isn‚Äôt a moral philosopher.</p>
		<p>So why the difference in the two outcomes?</p>
	</aside>
</section>
<section data-background="img/brain.gif" data-background-size="cover">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>One theory is that it's because two different parts of your brain are fighting with each other. Some researchers looked at people‚Äôs brains using fMRI machines, and demonstrated that "personal" dilemmas (like pushing a man off a footbridge) engage brain regions associated with emotion, whereas "impersonal" dilemmas (like diverting the trolley by flipping a switch) engaged regions associated with controlled reasoning. On these grounds, they advocate a dual-process account of moral decision-making.</p>
	</aside>
</section>
<section data-background="img/mvr.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Basically, inside your brain, you‚Äôve got a monkey and a robot fighting over the controls. Every time you have to make a moral decision, they duke it out.</p>
		<p>The monkey understands something simple like pushing someone off a bridge, and it's horrified. But it doesn't understand something complex like throwing a switch, so in that situation, the gut response of moral horror is lessened, and we feel able to throw the switch.</p>
		<p>Now some people have a stronger monkey, and some people have a stronger robot, and that's great, because both are useful in different situations.</p>
		<p>But this is tricky for we programmers, because we work on complex problems, which might make it trickier for our monkey brains to trigger moral responses.</p>

		<p>We established earlier that ethical reasoning involves an internal struggle for control. And a weird thing about humans is that we can sometimes actually ‚Äòforget‚Äô to act ethically, when we‚Äôre so focussed on achieving a goal that we forget to think about consequences of our actions.</p>
		<p>Or else we justify it to ourselves in ways that don‚Äôt stand up to scrutiny, but never stop to reflect whether our justifications hold up. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all done this at some point, I definitely have, and it‚Äôs led to some of my biggest screwups.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>There's some good news, though: We established that it's easy for people to act unethically when they don't think about it. The flip side to this, is that it follows that people tend to act more ethically when you remind them to.</p>

		<p>For instance, some researchers in Newcastle found that just hanging up posters of staring human eyes was enough to significantly change people's behaviour, and made people twice as likely to clean up after themselves.</p>
