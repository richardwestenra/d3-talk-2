		<p>About my background: I started out at university studying engineering, and I hated it, so I quickly switched to a philosophy degree, which I loved. Now, ten years later, my official job title is front end engineer, and I guess engineering is pretty great after all?</p>

		<p>I’ve now been coming to FEL regularly for about four years, but this is my first time getting up on stage. At first I was a bit too nervous to actually talk to anyone in the pub, so I’d just go straight home after the talks.</p>
		<p>But over time I started actually talking to people, and it’s become a big part of my life in London. I’ve met some close friends here, I found a new coworker here, I learned about the codebar community here, and now I’m an organiser there, and you should totally come join us. And I got my current job through the FEL slack group, which you should also totally join. (you’re welcome Patrick). And none of that would have happened without FEL, so, thanks Made by Many!</p>

		<p>But this talk isn’t about me - Actually, it's about ethics in software engineering.</p>
		<p>I mentioned before that my job title these days is front-end engineer. I've always felt a bit uncomfortable with the title of engineer: It felt like I was claiming some sort of prestige that I hadn't earned.</p>
		<p>I didn't complete my engineering degree, and definitely didn't study computer science: I'm mostly self-taught. I think I’m pretty good at my job, but I still feel like I'm basically hacking stuff together a lot of the time.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, we who build websites used to call ourselves webmasters - which I still think is a great job title. I'm kinda sad that I didn't start this job early enough to have a webmaster job in CV job history section.</p>
		<p>Then we were web developers, and now a lot of us are front-end engineers.</p>
		<p>I don’t think that's a bad thing, or that we should stop calling ourselves engineers - call yourself whatever you want, you can be a techno-viking or an agile pirate-ninja if it makes you feel better.</p>

		<p>We used to be working on dinky little websites that were kind of thrown together, and now we're working on massive, professional operations that form the financial backbone of multi-billion dollar corporations. We've come a long, long way from being webmasters.</p>
		<p>But a lot of us are self-taught and didn't go through any standardised training process. And this is great, it helps ease barriers to entry. But as the industry gets more professional, it might be worth thinking about other trappings of professionalism. If we're going to call ourselves engineers, then there are ethical duties and codes of responsibility that go along with that title.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Philosophers like to do things called "thought experiments", which are like real experiments but even better, because you never need to get out of your armchair.</p>
		<p>One of the most famous is the trolley problem.</p>
		<p>There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:</p>
		<p>Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.</p>
		<p>Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.</p>
		<p>Which is the most ethical choice?</p>

<section data-background="img/fat-man.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Now, imagine instead of a switch, you’re standing on a bridge over the tracks, next to an extremely fat man. The trolley is coming, and the only way you can stop it is to push the fat man onto the tracks. He’s the only one big enough to slow down the trolley.</p>
		<p>He’s looking you right in the eyes, he can see what you’re thinking, and he’s terrified, begging you not to do it. What do you do?</p>
	</aside>

<section>
	<p>9 out of 10 people would throw the switch,</p>
	<p>but only 1 in 10 people would push the fat man.</p>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys, which tend to find that approximately 9 out of 10 respondents would throw the switch to kill the one and save the five.</p>
		<p>However in the fat man scenario, the situation reverses, and only 1 in 10 people would push the fat man onto the tracks.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, a 2009 survey of professional philosophers found that only 68% of them would throw the switch, 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer. So if you’re ever tied to a train track by a cartoon villain, you’d better hope that the person by the switch isn’t a moral philosopher.</p>
		<p>So why the difference in the two outcomes?</p>

<section data-background="img/mvr.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>One theory is that it's because two different parts of your brain are fighting with each other. Researchers looked at people’s brains using fMRI machines, demonstrated that "personal" dilemmas (like pushing a man off a footbridge) engage brain regions associated with emotion, whereas "impersonal" dilemmas (like diverting the trolley by flipping a switch) engaged regions associated with controlled reasoning. On these grounds, they advocate a dual-process account of moral decision-making.</p>
		<p>Basically, inside your brain, you’ve got a monkey and a robot fighting over the controls. Some people have a stronger monkey, and other people have a stronger robot, but they both duke it out every time you have to make a moral decision.</p>
		<p>The monkey understands something simple like pushing someone off a bridge, but not something complex like throwing a switch.</p>
		<p>This is tricky for we programmers, because we work on complex problems, which might make it trickier for our monkey brains to trigger moral responses.</p>
