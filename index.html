		<p>Common problem: Choosing what to build it in.</p>
		<p class="meta">SLOW DOWN</p>
		<p>Charting libraries like Highcharts, Chartist, and Chartjs. Charting libraries built on top of d3, like Plotly, Formidable's Victory Charts (built in React: good option), C3, R2D3, NVD3, RJD2, D20, C4, R2D2, and the NVA. It's overwhelming.</p>
		<p>These libraries typically provide a few basic chart types, and abstract away most of the complexity. Whether this is help or a hindrance depends on your use case.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Pros of using charting libraries:</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li class="fragment">Quick to use</li>
    <li class="fragment">Simpler to learn</li>
    <li class="fragment">More readable, usually</li>
  </ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>In general, and obviously it depends on the library, but the advantages of using a charting library is that:</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>1. You can get something built quickly</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. Less upfront time investment</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>3. Usually more readable than D3, though obviously it depends on the library</p>

  <h2>Cons of using charting libraries:</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li class="fragment">Variable performance</li>
    <li class="fragment">Limited features & restrictive APIs</li>
  </ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>On the other hand they have some disadvantages too:</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>1. They're not always performant enough: Sometimes because of excessive download size, and sometimes in terms of animation performance. I've found they can be a bit janky at times if you're doing something complex.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. Less control: Abstractions may not fit your use case. Because they're usually fairly opinionated, they don't always do everything you want them to. Often I find that it's not until a chart is nearly done that I discover the limitations of a given library's API, and realise that it it's not able to implement certain quirks of the design I've been given. So then I have to start all over again in something else.</p>
		<p>So what I often do is prototype an MVP in a charting library, then build a more fleshed-out version in D3 once I've got more time to invest.</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section data-background="img/d3.jpg" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="white">
  <aside class="notes">
		<p>But some of you might be wondering what D3 is, and why I didn't include it in the list. After all, it's a data visualisation library too. But unlike the others, it's much more low-level, enough so to be a whole different sort of animal. It's a bit more like jQuery or Underscore than a true charting library, in the sense that, rather than giving you ready-built charts or chart components that you can configure, it gives you the tools to build your own custom charts from scratch, along with a set of best practices.</p>
		<p>And in fact the syntax looks pretty similar to jQuery too. So if you like method chaining, you'll love it</p>
    <p>D3 is also designed to enforce separation of concerns between data and presentation, just like the web was traditonally supposed to with HTML & CSS. I know that's not a popular idea these days, what with CSS in JS and all, but it can still be a useful model at times. Fight me.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Pros of using D3:</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li class="fragment">Powerful</li>
    <li class="fragment">Flexible</li>
    <li class="fragment">Performant</li>
    <li class="fragment">Popular and well-established</li>
  </ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>There are several advantages to using D3 over other charting libraries:</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN _ _ _ _ Slow down!</p>
		<p>1. D3 gives you full control over how things look, and has so many different tools and algorithms that you can mix and match to create really cool effects. I've been working with d3 for about 4 years and I still regularly come across things where I'm like, whoa, D3 can do that?</p>
		<p>It's also very large. Lots of different APIs. Huge file size if you import the whole thing, but it's modular, as of version 4, so you can just import the bits you want.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. Works seamlessly with existing web technologies. Plays well with other tools. Can manipulate any part of the DOM, or use it with SVG, Canvas, WebGL, or whatever.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>3. D3's animations are usually really smooth, even with transitions involving hundreds of different objects.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>4. Large community, lots of examples, tutorials, stackoverflow questions, demos.</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Cons of using D3:</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li class="fragment">Steeper learning curve</li>
    <li class="fragment">More complex</li>
    <li class="fragment">Takes longer to make a basic chart</li>
    <li class="fragment">Have to give talks about using D3 + React</li>
  </ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>On the other hand, there are some downsides:</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>1. It can take a longer to get your head around it, especially the data binding which is a bit counterintuitive.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. The code can be a bit more complex to read, which means you need to put more thought into documenting it.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>3. If you just want to do a standard chart type like a bar or line chart, D3 will definitely take longer. I find that it's best to use it in situations where you're given a specific design that you need to implement as closely as possible.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>4. Finally, if you learn D3 then eventually your flatmate will ask you to speak about it at her meetup. So there's that.</p>

	<h1>D3 + React</h1>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>I mentioned that D3 plays well with other tools, and that includes React. But when using them together, you need to make a big decision about which to use for updating the DOM.</p>
		<p>D3 is still perfectly fine to use for layout calculations even if you use React for all the DOM rendering, and in fact, out of D3's 30 different modules, 22 of them don’t have any API methods that come in direct contact with the DOM!</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Updating the DOM</h2>
	<div class="flex">
		<div class="fragment">
			<h4>D3</h4>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Complex animation</li>
				<li>SVG helpers, e.g. axes</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="fragment">
			<h4>React</h4>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Better code structure</li>
				<li>More readable</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So it's fine if you just want to use React, but they're both great for DOM rendering in their own separate ways, and each have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>1. For instance, D3 is great for animation, and has some great out-of-the-box SVG helpers for tricky things like axes.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. But D3 code tends to make your chart less structured, by putting the whole chart in one component, which can lead to tight-coupling between the individual parts. It's also a bit less readable than React's declarative syntax.</p>
		<p>It's a pretty tough call! I like the structure and readability that comes by using React components, but I also like using the transitions directly on the DOM elements.</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section data-background="img/why-not-both.gif" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So why not choose a hybrid approach? What I like to do is to combine both approaches: Let React render static components, but use D3 for axes, and anything that needs complex animations. You can mix and match the syntax together, and see what works for you.</p>
		<p class="meta">Slow down</p>
		<p>If you want to use D3 for DOM rendering in a React component, you just need to pass a container ref to your D3 code, and run it in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. There's a great article by Elijah Meeks with more details about how to do it, which I'll tweet a link to after this talk.</p>

	<h2>Transitions</h2>
	<p>Enter (add) / Exit (delete) / Update:</p>
	<svg class="chart" id="update"></svg>
	<p><small><code id="updateArray"></code></small></p>
  <aside class="notes">
		<p>I mentioned that one reason I really like d3 is its flexibility with animations - demonstrated here with a bar chart showing a random number of random numbers, updated every 2 seconds.</p>
		<p>D3 makes it easy to add separate transitions for adding, deleting, or updating elements. You can also easily add an incremental transition delay per element, for a neat ripple effect.</p>
		<p>If you're using React for the DOM and you want sophisticated JS animations for your chart transitions, you still can, but you'll need use something like Greensock or React-Transition-Group.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-background="img/devices.gif" data-background-size="cover">
  <aside class="notes">
		<p>When it comes to responsive charts for mobile devices, you also have a few different approaches you can take.</p>
		<p>If your chart doesn’t include any text then you can just treat the chart like any other vector image, and scale it with CSS. However most charts include text for things like axes, so this won't work most of the time.</p>
		<p>Instead, you'll need to manually set the chart dimensions based on the container component's width and height, once the component mounts.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-background="img/resize.gif" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="white">
  <aside class="notes">
		<p>If you want to ensure that it works after resizing the screen, then add an event listener for window resize, and update the chart. This will make testing easier, and also ensure that your chart works even when users rotate their device or resize their browser window.</p>
		<!-- <p class="meta">Maybe?</p>
    <p>Choose chart types with modular designs, so that elements can be rearranged.</p> -->

	<h1>Have fun with it</h1>
  <aside class="notes">
		<p>Finally, you don't have to use D3 for just charts. There are loads of layout algorithms to play with, and you can get creative with them. It's great for adding little playful flourishes to your websites, or talk slides.</p>
